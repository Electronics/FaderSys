# FaderSys
Motorised Fader Bank Controller for Chamsys MagicQ using OSC

Why have a boring fader wing or whatever, when you can have *motorised faders*!!

This uses the OSC tx/rx protocol built into magicQ (needs to be out of demo mode) and uses an execute page to store multiple cuestacks that can be triggered remotely via this custom wing.
